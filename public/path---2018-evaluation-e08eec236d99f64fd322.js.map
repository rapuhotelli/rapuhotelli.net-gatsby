I felt a familiar, bitter rage boil inside me that could only be described as madness. I see thought-clouding red everywhere, but it’s not anger, exactly. My madness is disbelief mixed with bitter amusement. Imagine a Disney villain laughing maniacally. It’s an utter, surreal disappointment in the world. Of course, I bear no ill will toward any of the human beings I encounter. Rather, I see people as vessels sent to <strong>laugh at me</strong> at my expense like schoolyard bullies – except the bullies are everyone in the world. <em>Never forget that</em> <strong>you</strong> <em>have failed. You do not belong among us</em>, they scream, blaming for something I cannot grasp.</p>\\n<p>Thus, my madness is a coping mechanism of a kind.

I’m proud of myself that this time it didn’t last that long. Typically I suppress emotions gone wild by eating so much I pass out, to prevent further harm, but this time my madness lasted only an hour or two. I took this opportunity to contemplate and decided I should probably come up with some kind of goals for life. I believe this “depression” of mine is curable if I ever became satisfied with myself, that is, not carrying the blaming weight of the world on my shoulders.

This is why a change of employer is such a big deal for me. In a groundhog day, I am safe. It’s predictable. Breaking it would expose me to the world, which is probably what I need the most, really… Being vulnerable without fear. I identify the following things as my key obstacles and changing them somehow would help the most, but I’m having a hard time affecting them in my current groundhog state. </p>\\n<h4>Professional identity</h4>\\n<p>Professionally I should pick a focus. I hail from the early days of the internet where specializations didn’t exist, and today not specializing is a slow, stressful suicide. However, my new employer (which I love to death) encourages generalization, further adding to my stress. </p>\\n<h4>Home function</h4>\\n<p>Right now my home is worthless. It’s just a place where I sleep and spend some time so that the next workday came around sooner. I try to do “hobbies” at home, like music and cooking and whatever, but it’s shallow. I don’t get true satisfaction from my time at home. Is that normal? How would I improve this?</p>\\n<h4>Love somebody</h4>\\n<p>This is something I try not to think of. This is the greatest exposure of your weaknesses and I’m probably never going to be able to risk it again. Then again, it offers the greatest risk-reward ratio regarding sanity, but the rational nerd in me tosses this aside as a completely irrelevant task – there simply isn’t <em>enough</em> to be gained. The <em>non</em>-rational human being is also suspicious: as time passes I find it increasingly harder to express any kind of realistic infatuation. I don’t have the energy to go after a partner, and as a quote on one of our office’s whiteboards elegantly put it:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Love is like a fart. If you have to force it, it’s probably shit.  </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h4>Love anybody</h4>\\n<p>I mean, I have friends and I love them but true friends… not very many. Whenever I’m in danger of befriending someone too closely, I usually strayed away in an effort to maintain a safe distance. People most often acted strangely and I felt some awkward expectations.
