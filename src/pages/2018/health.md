_So... a new job, huh?_ It's weird, though. I don't know where I'm going. Why even change company and take a colossal financial risk (not to mention risking sanity), if everything was fine? Overcoming the fear of new challenges and doing all of the social workout bullshit all over again with an even larger group of people. Why would you do that? 

I managed to nearly completely reset my social circles, for starters. For some reason I fought against it a little, but I have finally become a victim of my field â€“ the greatest people I know are professionals, and the more time I spend with them, the more the world seems to be at peace. When people say you marry your work, I guess this is what they mean - including the nagging feeling of dread, the disappointments, and hoping that the inevitable divorce would come on your terms.

## Ban all the things!

Anyway, a fairly refreshing change of pace. So refreshing that I decided to basically kill myself ;) No, not literally (let's wait for it), but efficiently and swiftly detaching myself from many of the old vices that so well defined me in a life gone by. It feels like plucking feathers off a fat pigeon until what remains is a dysfunctional blob and looks even dumber than before. _&ast;Cough&ast;..._ more specifically, I'm starting with a complete ban on coffee and nicotine, cold turkey style! 

I did mean coffee and not caffeine. I react very strongly to coffee for some reason. Most energy drinks are fine, though the overdose of sugar is an entirely different story. So far three weeks without coffee feels pretty great: I sleep well, I am not tired at work and I can actually focus at work. I do miss the _habit_ - having an excuse to wander about and initiating conversations. I outsourced my motivation to my colleagues. If they see me with coffee, they are obligated to slap me in the face or perform any other unspecified violation. It's a great motivator!
 
### Nicodemus

The real fight here is nicotine. I did quit active smoking a while back, because the state of my lungs does interest me, but the _snus_ used up here in the north is just so pleasant, harmless and a fun little hobby, albeit sometimes smelly. It's the little fact that deep inside I don't actually want to quit nicotine. It sounds dumb but I really owe nicotine a large chunk of my sanity, success and friends. A cigarette was my little, miserable candle in the dark. A cigarette was one of the only moral choices I could make myself in an utterly defeated mindset. If I wanted to smoke a cigarette I would fucking smoke it and I would receive that tiny little rebellious satisfaction from it. I don't regret a single cigarette I've had even if tomorrow I collapsed from a mystery cancer. It's easy to be smug about a statement like that but you have to understand the utter defeat people can face and the scale of the smallest of joys. 

Regardless, I don't particularly need it anymore. The hill I've climbed is quite the queen of all nipples but I can do without, for now. The struggle is filling that hobby with something else. Every day I get this feeling that _oh this installs for 30 minutes? what a good time for a smoke_. What do people normally do? I must _do_ some action at all times. I allow myself downtime only if I'm able to justify it - with a smoke, for example. Is this what the fidget spinner craze was about? Is this what people do? 

Other effects are grumpiness. For the longest time I didn't want to even think of quitting just for the sake of my friends. Withdrawal gives me strange anxiety problems and wildly swinging moods. I get grumpy very easily and the simplest things distract me. Recovering from these grumpiness sessions is quite fascinating, actually. They're followed by an intense self consciousness period where I brutally judge myself and distance myself from my friends who totally don't "deserve me" or something. It's a slippery slope I have to monitor very closely as the mental drop can deal a large amount of damage.
